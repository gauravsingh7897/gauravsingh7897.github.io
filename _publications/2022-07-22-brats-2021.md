Segmentation of brain tumor is challenging due presence of healthy or background region more compared to tumor regions and also the tumor region itself divided in edema, tumor core and non enhancing regions makes it hard to segment. Given the scarcity of such data, it becomes more challenging. In this paper, we built a 3D-UNet based architecture for multimodal brain tumor segmentation task. We have reported results on BraTS 2021 Validation and Test Dataset. We achieved a Dice value of 0.87, 0.76 and 0.73 on whole tumor region, tumor core region and enhancing part respectively for Validation Data and 0.73, 0.67 and 0.63 on whole tumor region, tumor core region and enhancing part respectively for Test Data.
